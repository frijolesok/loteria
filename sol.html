	<p align="justify">The sun shines it's light all across our planetary system, it is the main star where every planet orbirts around it, the light that comes to us is not as hot as in mercury and venus, but, it is not as cold as in mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune and pluto. it's a mild ligt that nutrates all of our planet making life possible, it also maintains us safe from the obscurity sin it covers a big part of the earth in the day cycle.</p>
